# I need you to change this project with the following guidelines :

so we have the folllwing stuff : 
the actual map
POIs (points refering to the 360 images and the important building in lifjell art museum)
then we can go to tour within the 360 images using a button on the popup box when clicking
on the point of interest. 
then in the 360 images there can be posters created by the admin users
These aestethic posters by the admin posters should be like posters on the wall of university\
with different colors which could include images and texts. 
now only admins should be able to add texts 
and also the 360 image view should have the following feature : 
Panellum supports WebVR and WebXR for immersive viewing through compatible headsets. You enable it by setting "hfov": 110 and "autoLoad": true in the viewer config, and by including "showFullscreenCtrl": true and "showVRButton": true. The VR mode activates via the headset icon once the panorama is loaded in a browser that supports WebXR (like Chromium-based ones).
this can make watching this website with VR interesting.
